      content="At [Opal Trading DMCC], we are committed to promoting sustainability by upcycling recycled materials which are sourced from suppliers around the world. We are able to give new life to materials that would otherwise end up in landfills or polluting the environment.

      Our goal is to create a more sustainable and circular economy by upcycling these recycled materials and producing a quality flake or granulate. By doing so, we help support and build a sustainable yet circular economy. We are proud to be a part of the movement towards a more sustainable future.
      
      We prioritize sustainable practices throughout the sourcing and upcycling process to ensure that the materials we use are environmentally responsible and do not contribute to further harm to our planet. At [Opal Trading DMCC], we believe that sustainability is not only a responsibility but also an opportunity to create a better future for ourselves and future generations.
      
      Join us in our mission to promote sustainability and a circular economy by partnering with us for your upcycled plastic needs."

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
